  Akan Name Generator

##Project description.
  A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then        depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.

##Author(s) information.
  An upcoming software engineer and internet entrepreneur working to bring the future today.

##Setup instructions
  -See a small description of what the application does on the landing page.
  -Enter my relevant details through a form.
  -Input your gender.
  -Click the submit button to see what your Akan name would be.

##BDD.
  The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
